From an early age, I have been fascinated by the way science can improve lives. Pharmacy appeals to me because it combines my interest in chemistry and biology with a practical role in healthcare, allowing me to make a direct impact on patient wellbeing. The idea of being part of a profession that ensures safe and effective use of medicines motivates me to pursue this path.

My academic studies have strengthened this ambition. Chemistry has taught me how molecular structures influence drug action, while biology has deepened my understanding of human physiology and disease. I enjoy problem-solving and applying scientific principles to real-world challenges, which is central to pharmacy practice. Through independent research, I have explored topics such as drug formulation and the role of pharmacists in antimicrobial stewardship, which highlighted the importance of innovation and responsibility in this field.

Beyond the classroom, I have developed skills that will help me succeed at university. Working part-time has taught me time management and communication, while volunteering in a community setting gave me insight into the importance of empathy and clear advice when supporting others. These experiences reinforced my desire to work in a profession that combines technical knowledge with patient care.

Pharmacy is a dynamic and evolving discipline, and I am excited by the prospect of contributing to areas such as personalised medicine and public health. Studying pharmacy at university will give me the scientific foundation and professional training to become a competent, ethical, and patient-focused pharmacist. I am eager to embrace the challenges of this course and develop the skills needed to make a meaningful difference in healthcare.

## Immigration requirements

International students studying in the UK whilst holding a visa or residence permit are required to observe the Immigration Rules and act in accordance with these rules.

### Student route (formerly Tier 4) visa holders

If you enter the UK on a student route you will have certain responsibilities in terms of complying with the Immigration Rules. It is very important that you are aware of these responsibilities and that you take them seriously.

Your responsibilities will include:

- Ensuring you have a visa or residence permit with the University of Nottinghamâ€™s Sponsor Licence Number on it (RFDX42DB2). You will not be able to register on your course if you are holding a visa for another institution unless you can demonstrate that you have submitted a visa application to study at the University of Nottingham
- Providing the University with a copy of your passport and visa/biometric residence permit when you complete in person registration (or via the Student Services Centre if you obtain a new visa or passport in the future)
- Keeping your contact details in the UK up to date via your NottinghamHub account
- Registering for your course on time
- Studying whilst you are in the UK (ensuring you sign up for the right number of credits and have good attendance on your course with no significant gaps or absences)
- Following University processes if you decide that you would like to defer or suspend your studies or withdraw from your course
- Returning home if you stop studying in the UK (for example if you defer or suspend your studies, withdraw from your course or your course is terminated)
- Observing the Immigration Rules and any restrictions on working attached to your visa

Failure to fulfil the responsibilities outlined above may amount to a breach of Immigration Regulations and can lead to suspension and/or withdrawal from your course.  Please visit  [www.nottingham.ac.uk/go/limitations](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/go/limitations) for further details.

**During the course of your studies, the University may need to contact the Home Office about your immigration status to ensure that you are able to enter or remain in the UK legally. By Registering with the University you confirm that you consent to us contacting the Home Office for this purpose.**



### Those holding alternative (non-student) immigration status to study at the University

Full time students from outside the UK/Ireland who are studying under a different immigration status in the UK are also required to provide the University with evidence of their right to study permission (immigration status documents) when commencing their studies and anytime thereafter should their status change or be updated.

**Part-time** students must have your passport and visa scanned at a Student Services Centre each time you re-enter the UK to continue with your studies.



### Advice and guidance

The University has a team of Immigration Advisers who can provide further guidance or onwards referral on a range of UK immigration matters. You can contact the team by visiting [www.nottingham.ac.uk/internationalstudents/advisers](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/internationalstudents/advisers)

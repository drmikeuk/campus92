## Immigration requirements

International students studying in the UK whilst holding a visa or residence permit are required to observe the Immigration Rules and act in accordance with these rules.

### Student visa holders

If you enter the UK on a student visa you will have specific responsibilities under the UK Immigration Rules. It is very important that you are aware of these responsibilities and that you take them seriously.

[Please take time to review and understand your responsibilities as detailed here.](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studywithus/international-applicants/visa-help/student-route/responsibilities.aspx)

Failure to fulfil the responsibilities outlined above may amount to a breach of Immigration Regulations and can lead to suspension and/or withdrawal from your course.  Please visit [www.nottingham.ac.uk/go/limitations](www.nottingham.ac.uk/go/limitations) for further details.

**During the course of your studies, the University may need to contact the Home Office about your immigration status to ensure that you are able to enter or remain in the UK legally. By Registering with the University you confirm that you consent to us contacting the Home Office for this purpose.**


### Those holding alternative (non-student) immigration status to study at the University

Full time students from outside the UK/Ireland who are studying under a different immigration status in the UK are also required to provide the University with evidence of their right to study permission (immigration status documents) when commencing their studies and anytime thereafter should their status change or be updated.

### Part time students

Part-time students do not enter the UK under the student route and do not complete face-to-face registration with the University.  If you are a part-time student you must present your passport and visa at Cherry Tree Lodge each time you re-enter the UK to continue with your studies.



### Advice and guidance

The University has a team of Immigration Advisers who can provide further guidance or onwards referral on a range of UK immigration matters.  You can contact the team by visiting: [www.nottingham.ac.uk/internationalstudents/advisers] (www.nottingham.ac.uk/internationalstudents/advisers)

**By completing online registration you confirm that you have understood and agree to the above information.**

## Immigration requirements

International students studying in the UK while under immigration control are required to observe the UK Immigration Rules and act in accordance with these rules.

### Student visa holders
[Please take time to review and understand your responsibilities as detailed here.](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studywithus/international-applicants/visa-help/student-route/responsibilities.aspx)

Failure to comply may amount to a breach of Immigration Regulations and can lead to suspension and/or withdrawal from your course.

[Limitations on immigration sponsorship](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/go/limitations) at the University of Nottingham are detailed here.

### Those holding alternative (non-student) immigration status

Full time students from outside the UK/Ireland studying under non-student immigration status in the UK are required to provide the University with evidence of their right to study permission (immigration status documents) when commencing their studies and anytime thereafter should their status change or be updated.

### Part-time students

International part-time students do not enter the UK under the student route and are not required to complete in-person registration with the University.  If you are a part-time student you must present your passport and visa at Cherry Tree Lodge each time you re-enter the UK to continue with your studies.


### Advice and guidance

Please [contact the University Immigration Advisers](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/internationalstudents/advisers) for further guidance or onwards referral on a range of UK immigration matters.

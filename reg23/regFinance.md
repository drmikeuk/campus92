## Financial information

### Tuition fees

Your tuition fees and payment due dates will be displayed in the <b>Finance</b> section on NottinghamHub. You must pay your fees by these due dates.

If you have applied for a Student Loans Company tuition fee loan but it is not showing on your ‘Finance’ account by the end of November, please email [financialsupport@nottingham.ac.uk](mailto:financialsupport@nottingham.ac.uk).


**Sponsorship**: If your fees are being paid by an organisation other than yourself, you must provide evidence of this sponsorship. Please upload your sponsorship letter via the <b>Documents</b> section on NottinghamHub, guides showing how to do this are available [here](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studentservices/services/sponsorship.aspx).

<!--
**Scholarships and other funding**<br/>If you are in receipt of a scholarship, stipend or other funding from the University of Nottingham, it will be displayed in the <b>Finance</b> section on NottinghamHub.

Please [contact Student Services](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studentservices/) immediately if you cannot see the scholarship you are expecting.

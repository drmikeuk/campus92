## Financial information

### Tuition fees

Your tuition fees and payment due dates will be displayed in the <b>Finance</b> section on NottinghamHub. You must pay your fees by these [due dates](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/academicservices/currentstudents/fees-information/how-and-when-to-pay-student-fees.aspx).

### Finance & Funding

Once you are fully registered and the University has received confirmation of your tuition fee loan from the SLC it will be shown against your tuition fee liability in the **Finance** section in your NottinghamHub.  If you have applied for a SLC tuition fee loan this will show on your **Finance** account by the end of November

If your tuition fees are covered by the NHS this will be shown against your tuition fee liability.

You may be eligible for a core bursary – [find more information here.](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studentservices/support/financialsupport/bursariesandscholarships/bursaries/core-bursary-assessment-procedure.aspx)

If you are in receipt of a scholarship, stipend or other funding from the University of Nottingham, it will be displayed in the **Finance** section in your NottinghamHub.

If your fees are being paid by an organisation other than yourself, you **must provide evidence** of this sponsorship – [find more information here](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studentservices/servicedetails/sponsor-relations/services-and-information-for-sponsored-students.aspx).

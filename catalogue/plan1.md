## Programme description

BA Law thoroughly covers the foundations of English law. Core modules examine areas including tort, contract, trusts, criminal law and public law. Our optional modules allow you to specialise in the areas of law that interest you. If you don't want to practise law as a career, you can choose optional modules from subjects outside of the school, which will expand your knowledge and career opportunities in a wide variety of sectors. We also offer the opportunity to apply in your second year to transfer to one of our four-year programmes, which include a year abroad at a partner law school in locations including Australia, Europe or the USA. Students who have participated have proved to be very attractive to employers. You will graduate with specialist knowledge and the transferable skills and confidence you need to stand out to employers as you start your career.

**Exemptions**<br/>
All our undergraduate law degrees allow exemption from the academic stage of qualification as a Barrister. Graduates wishing to qualify as barristers may proceed directly to the vocational stage of legal training, the Bar Training Course. Students who wish to become a solicitor must undertake the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE). There are no exemptions conferred on students who have an undergraduate law degree. A number of institutions offer courses preparing students to pass the SQE. Some of these institutions guarantee a place for Nottingham graduates with at least a 2.2 degree.


## Distinguishing features

**Study abroad**<br/>
On this course, you can apply to switch to a four-year degree and spend your third year studying abroad in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore or the USA. Teaching is typically in English, but there may be opportunities to study in another language if you are sufficiently fluent.

Please note: In order to switch to a four-year degree and study abroad, you will need to achieve the relevant academic requirements as set by the university and meet the selection criteria of both the university and the partner institution. The partner institution is under no obligation to accept you even if you do meet the relevant criteria.

**Optional placement year**<br/>
If your course does not have a compulsory placement, integrated year in industry or compulsory year abroad where there is already an opportunity to undertake a work placement as part of that experience, you may be able to apply to undertake an optional placement year. While it is the student’s responsibility to find and secure a placement, our Careers and Employability Service will support you throughout this process. Contact placements@nottingham.ac.uk to find out more.

The school/faculty you are joining may also have additional placement opportunities. Please visit the school/faculty website for more information.

Please note: In order to undertake an optional placement year, you will need to achieve the relevant academic requirements as set by the university and meet any requirements specified by the placement host. There is no guarantee that you will be able to undertake an optional placement as part of your course.

**Key information**<br/>
Please be aware that study abroad, compulsory year abroad, optional placements/internships and integrated year in industry opportunities may change at any time for a number of reasons, including curriculum developments, changes to arrangements with partner universities or placement/industry hosts, travel restrictions or other circumstances outside of the university’s control. Every effort will be made to update this information as quickly as possible should a change occur.


## Teaching delivery

**Teaching methods**<br/>
Teaching is via a range of methods and approaches, which may include Lectures, Seminars and Tutorials

**Skillegal programme**<br/>
We offer a series of optional workshops on skills such as presentation, communication and negotiation. Delivered by a range of law firms and chambers from London and the regions, the workshops are designed to be interactive and fun and to provide you with an understanding of the skills needed to become a successful lawyer. The legal profession will be looking for evidence of these skills when you apply for legal training in your penultimate year.

**Legal Skills Team**<br/>
The Legal Skills Team help undergraduate law students with their academic legal skills. Their aim is to ensure that every student, regardless of background or performance, has someone they can approach to discuss the development of their legal study skills.

We run a legal skills programme that caters for all students throughout the academic year and offer a variety of seminars and workshops for different year groups to address and respond to the specific needs of each.

http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/academicservices/qualitymanual/assessmentandawards/undergraduate-programme-regulations.aspx

### Assessment marking criteria

All Supplementary or course Regulations should be read in the context of the relevant University Study Regulations.

Please refer to this information on http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/regulations/


### Progression information

Candidates who fail to achieve 40% in non-compensable law modules will be required to resit the failed module(s). Where a candidate fails to achieve 40% on a resit of such non-compensable law module(s), that candidate will normally be allowed one further opportunity to satisfy the examiners, but only if that candidate has passed 80 credits during the academic year in question and achieved a mark of at least 30% in any failed module(s). Candidates may not progress until they have achieved a mark of at least 40% in all non-compensable law modules.

A candidate who has completed the first year of the BA Law may switch to the LLB. Such a candidate must take Foundations of Tort and all law options in their second and final years.

### Course weightings %

| Part I    | 33.00   |
| Part II   | 77.00   |
{:.table .table-sm .notFullWidth}

### Degree calculation model

Arithmetic Mean


## Other regulations

The Bar Standards Board and Solicitor Regulation Authority (for students who began studies prior to 31st December 2021) require students to achieve a pass mark of 40% in the seven foundation subjects (Foundations of Tort, Law of Contract, Public Law, Land Law, Criminal Law, Law of the European Union and Law of Trusts) in order to be awarded a degree recognised as a Qualifying Law Degree.

Students who fail to meet this requirement in Qualifying Year and Part I modules (Foundations of Tort, Law of Contract, Public Law, Land Law and Criminal Law) are given the opportunity to resit these modules in order to progress.

Where a resit has taken place in a Part I module, the resit mark will be used for progression purposes only; the original fail mark will be used in the calculation of the weighted mean for that stage.

Students who fail to meet this requirement in Part II modules (Law of the European Union and Law of Trusts) may be given the opportunity to resit these modules for professional purposes only, i.e. a resit pass mark will enable students to be awarded a Qualifying Law Degree but will not be recorded on their diploma supplement; the original fail mark will be used in the calculation of the weighted mean for that stage.

## Learning outcomes

### Overview
<span class="note">don't display heading if no content?</span>

### Assessment summary

Legal knowledge is assessed through a combination of unseen written examinations; essays; and dissertations (optional).

Cognitive processes are assessed through a combination of unseen written examinations; essays; and dissertations (optional). Assessments include both essay type questions and problem type questions, in which students must advise on the application of the law to a fictitious legal problem.

Practical skills are assessed through a combination of unseen written examinations; essays; and dissertations (optional). Assessments include both essay type questions and problem type questions in which students must advise on the application of the law to a fictitious legal problem.

Transferable skills are assessed formally through a combination of unseen written examinations and essays. Assessments include both essay type questions and problem type questions in which students must advise on the application of the law to a fictitious legal problem. Students also have an opportunity to reflect on their own progress through the completion of Personal Academic Records (PARs).

### Teaching & learning

Acquisition of legal knowledge takes place through a combination of lectures, tutorials, and seminars. Such tried and tested methods of the academic stage of traditional legal education are enhanced where appropriate with elements of innovation in teaching and learning methods, such as interactive lectures or use of electronic discussion boards. The strong research performance of staff in their specialist subjects, combined with teaching excellence, ensures an ability to impart high levels of knowledge and awareness of the substantive law, including current developments in law and legal scholarship. Student led learning is promoted through directed independent reading of primary and secondary legal materials, to be read alongside the lectures and in preparation for participation in tutorials.

Acquisition of cognitive processes takes place through a combination of directed independent reading; tutorials; seminars (both teacher and student led); and formative essay writing. Feedback on formative assessment and on examination performance is given in all modules.

Practical skills are acquired through a step by step process in the foundation subjects and further refined and practised in optional modules. The skill to recognise and rank legal issues in terms of relevance and importance is introduced in Law of Contract, Foundations of Tort, and Public Law and students practise this skill further in Law of the European Union, Land Law, Criminal Law, Law of Trusts and optional modules. Initial guidance on other practical skills, and on how to write essays and prepare for tutorials and seminars, is given in the induction programme, and in Introduction to Law and Legal Theory, sessions led by the Law Librarian and seminars. These skills are developed throughout the foundation subjects, for instance through tutorials requiring reading and discussion of law reports and statutes (all foundation subjects); writing formative essays (Public Law, Law of Contract, Foundations of Tort, Land Law, Law of the European Union and Law of Trusts); formative examinations (Law of Contract, Foundations of Tort and Criminal Law); and retrieving and reading case law available only in electronic form (Law of the European Union). The skill to read and discuss legal materials which are written in complex and technical language is covered in all foundation subjects, which include reference to current legal developments and, where appropriate, proposed law reform.

Transferable skills permeate every activity within the programme. Communication skills and the ability to work effectively independently and in groups are fostered in particular in tutorials or seminars, at which attendance is compulsory (all foundation subjects). The skill to evaluate and assess own abilities, performance and understanding is met through provision of feedback on all formative and summative assessment (a selection from sample answers, notes on scripts, individual written comments, one-to-one feedback tutorials, revision lectures and exam script 'open days'). The use of electronic information is necessary for completion of formative essays, and is encouraged for tutorial preparation in all foundation subjects. The skill to use, present and evaluate numerical data is developed in Criminal Law, Public Law and Foundations of Tort. Problem solving skills are essential for participation in tutorials (all foundation subjects), and preparation of 'problem type' essay questions (Law of Contract, Foundations of Tort, Criminal Law, Land Law, Law of the European Union and Law of Trusts). Managing time and working to deadlines is developed through the students' management of the various deadlines and schedules involved in the programme, and notified to them early on in each semester, in activities such as guided independent reading, tutorial preparation, meeting essay deadlines and examination preparation (all foundation subjects).
